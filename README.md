# VAE annealing
## VAELoss
 VAELoss is a subclass of torch.nn.Module. It is a standard loss function for training VAE (variational autoencoder) neural network. It is callable and takes four argments: 
 * x (torch.Tensor): reconstructed input tensor
 * x0 (torch.Tensor): input tensor
 * mu (torch.Tensor): mean of the latent space
 * logvar (torch.Tensor): log variance of the latent space
  
 When called, it returns two instances of single-valued torch.Tensor, which can be passed to an optimizer: 
 * bce (recon loss component)
 * kld (divergence loss component)
  
## Annealer  
 Annealer is a class. An instance is created by passing two parameters:
 * slope_length (int): Number of epochs to reach full KL divergence weight
 * shape (str): Shape of the annealing function. Can be 'linear', 'cosine', or 'logistic'.  
 Annealer can be instantiated with disable=True parameter. This way an intance of Annealer can be still called, but the argument passed to the __call__() method will be returned unchanged.
  
 An instance of Annealer is callable.
 Args:
 * kld (torch.tensor): Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence loss (or any ohter loss object for which multiplication by a scalar is defined)
 Returns:
 * torch.tensor: KL divergence loss multiplied by the slope of the annealing function  
 
 ## Usage:
 An instance of Annealer class stores total_steps and current_steps integer attributes and uses them to calculate the slope of annealing function at each step. Annealer is to be instantiated before the training loop, ex:  
 ```
 from annealing import Annealer, VAELoss
  
 annealing_agent = Annealer(slope_length, shape='cosine')  # instantiating annealing agent
 criterion = VAELoss()  # instantiating VAELoss
  
 for epoch in range(100):  # training loop starts herre
     x, mu, logvar = model(x0)
     bce, kld = criterion(x, x0, mu, logvar)
     kld = annealing_agent(kld)
     optimizer.zero_grad()
     (bcd + kld).backward
     optimizer.step()
     annealing_agent.step()
 ```  
 After each epoch `annealing_agent.step()` method is to be called. This increases the current_step attribute by 1, unitl the value matches total_steps attribute. Based on those values, the slope of an annealing function is calculated. Initial value of current_step is always 1.
